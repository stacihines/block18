                                                      : Undefined / Error code

A function called "concatOdds" takes two arrays of integers as arguments. 
It should return a single array that only contains the odd numbers, in ascending order, from both of the arrays.

The "concatOdds" function can return:Incomplete/ Missing interger
                                    :inputs may contain positive and/or negative intergers in mixed order
